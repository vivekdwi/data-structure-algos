/**
 * {@link StampedLockExample} Class is an Example of
 * StampedLock Locking Mechanism
 *
 * Java 8 ships with a new kind of lock called StampedLock
 * which also support read and write locks just like in the
 * example above. In contrast to ReadWriteLock the locking
 * methods of a StampedLock return a stamp represented by a
 * long value. You can use these stamps to either release a
 * lock or to check if the lock is still valid. Additionally
 * stamped locks support another lock mode called optimistic
 * locking.
 *
 * Obtaining a read or write lock via readLock() or writeLock()
 * returns a stamp which is later used for unlocking within the
 * finally block. Keep in mind that stamped locks don't implement
 * reentrant characteristics. Each call to lock returns a new stamp
 * and blocks if no lock is available even if the same thread already
 * holds a lock. So you have to pay particular attention not to run
 * into deadlocks.
 *
 * Just like in the previous ReadWriteLock example both read tasks have
 * to wait until the write lock has been released. Then both read tasks
 * print to the console simultaneously because multiple reads doesn't block
 * each other as long as no write-lock is held.
